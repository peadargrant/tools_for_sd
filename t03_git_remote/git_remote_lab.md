# Git remote lab

## Cloning your repository

1. Choose a location on your computer (ideally NOT synced with OneDrive, GoogleDrive etc).
2. Log in to GitLab and navigate to your `tools_for_sd_labs` repository.
3. Hit the blue Clone button and copy the URL using the button provided.
4. In PowerShell/Terminal, navigate to the folder chosen in Step 1.
5. Type `git clone`, followed by a space and then paste the URL copied in Step 3.
6. You will have to enter your DkIT credentials.

## Working with your repository

The following should be completed in PowerShell / Terminal:

1. Use `cd` to change into your local working copy.
2. Use `mkdir` to make a new folder called `lab03` (exact spelling!).
3. Use `git log` to show the repository history (from your work directly in GitLab in previous labs).
4. Copy 2 Python files into your repository.
5. `Add` and `commit` the 2 files with the message `initial commit`.
6. Make 2 changes to the files.
7. Confirm that you can show these changes using `git diff`.
8. Add and commit these files with the message `changes made`.
