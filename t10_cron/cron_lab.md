# Cron lab

## Setup

On your XOA virtual machine:

1. Login over SSH.
2. cd into `tools_for_sd` and use `git pull --rebase` to update it.
3. cd into `tools_for_sd_labs` and use `git pull --rebase` to update it also.
4. Make a `lab10` folder and change into it.
5. Change back in to your home directory.
6. Confirm using `pwd` that you are in `/home/administrator`.


## Basic script

Compose a basic script called `status_update.sh` using `emacs` with the following specification:

Execute the following commands in order (you will have to discover / look up the appropriate commands and their switches):

1. Print the date and time
2. Print a 1-line description of the operating system version. 
3. Print out the disk usage of the machine in human-readable form (MB, GB etc).
4. List out the users currently logged in to the system

Make the appropriate changes so that you can run your script from Bash as `status_update.sh`. 


## Basic cron job

We are now going to run your script as a cron job.
To do this we need to edit the crontab file.

We do this using the `crontab -e` command that will launch an editor with a temporary copy of the crontab file.
When we save and exit, the cron system verifies that the crontab is correctly formatted.
(A similar pattern exists with certain files that configure `sudo`, `passwd` and others.)

Write an appropriate cron expression to:
Run the `status_update.sh` script every minute, directing the output to a file `latest_status.txt`.

Confirm that this functions correctly.
Don't move on until this works.


## Improved cron expression

Alter the cron expression to run the status update script every 5 minutes between 9AM-1PM Monday to Friday during the month of March.


## Submission

1. Change directory to `~/tools_for_sd_labs/lab10` folder.
2. Copy the files:
   - `status_update.sh`
   - `latest_status.txt`
   to this folder.
3. List out your cron jobs and re-direct this to a file `cron_jobs.txt`. 
4. Use `git add` to add the files in this folder to git.
5. Commit using `git commit -m 'message'` replacing 'message' with a suitable short message.
6. Push your commit(s) to GitLab using `git push`.
