\section{Loop Constructs}\label{loop-constructs}

Loop Constructs in a script are used when you want to repeat a command/s a number of times.

There are two main loop constructs in BASH shell:
\begin{itemize}
\item for
\item while
\end{itemize}


\section{for Construct}\label{for-construct}

The \texttt{for} construct is similar to that in Python:
\begin{itemize}
\item It operates on a list of strings
\item Can be used with files, directories, users, groups, numerical sequences etc.
\end{itemize}
Process:
\begin{enumerate}
\item When \texttt{for} Construct entered:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item creates a \emph{variable} (newDir in the previous example)
  \item \emph{sets its value to the first string} (dept1)
  \end{enumerate}
\item executes all commands between \emph{do} and \emph{done}  
\item  The next time the loop is run, the variable newDir takes the value of the second string.
\item This process continues until all strings are processed.  
\end{enumerate}

Example Task: Create three directories named dept1, dept2 and dept3
using a for Construct.

\section{While Construct}\label{while-construct}

A while construct is a type of loop that completes commands as long as
the tested condition is true (exist status code 0).

It is a useful construct to use when you want to read in content from a
text file and continue to do so until you reach the end of the file.

System Administrators use this construct a lot. It can be used with
files, directories, users, groups, etc.

Syntax is as follows:

Example Task: Use a While loop to read content from a text file:
